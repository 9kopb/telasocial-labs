This article is about Boot to Gecko and Mozilla and it's been updated for an upcoming event in São Carlos — to try out and test and learn and inspect Mozilla's Boot 2 Gecko in São Carlos Brazil — TBD for January 11th 2013

## Page repo 

The repository to this page [is git here](https://github.com/taboca/telasocial-labs/tree/master/pages/boot-to-gecko-mashing). 

## Intro

We would like to gather some local developers ( you can come from as far as you want ) to talk and test boot to gecko with a view that is not so tied to Mozilla community topics or priorization. This is a kind of a Hack and Do Whatever You Like free form event. 


## Related Seasonal 

It's important to pay attention about some of the things Mozilla is coordinating in 2013 first quarter. Last week I spoke with Diana (@mozilla) an employee that works with marketing and her team is organizing what apps are going to be demoed in the upcoming [Mobile World Congress in Barcelona](http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/keynote-speakers/). 

* Mobile World Congress — expect Mozilla to say launch related news and apps to be demoed

## Resources

* [Firefox OS Simulator Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-os-simulator/) is a separated process and you can get the actual B2G in your desktop — this is probably an approach to take and change Gecko chrome for the braves in the web app that want to be closer to the 'chrome'. 

## pt-BR marcio's post

Estamos pensando em um evento compatível com Boot2Gecko Mozilla na Sexta-feira para estudar o que é e como instalar compilar o sistema operacional da Mozilla que vem aí. Se alguém quiser juntar com alguns ex-alunos me escreva mgalli em telasocial dot com. A ideia é usar parte da Sexta-feira com isso e tomar de noite. 

## Venue

* São Carlos city 
* place : TBD
* From noon to 8PM
* Happy Hour late: yes 
* Contact mgalli at telasocial dot com or fabricio at fabricio dot org
