## 1st quarter of 2013 with Mozilla 

It's important to pay attention about some of the things Mozilla is coordinating in 2013 first quarter. Last week I spoke with Diana (@mozilla) an employee that works with marketing and her team is organizing what apps are going to be demoed in the upcoming [Mobile World Congress in Barcelona](http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/keynote-speakers/). 

* [25th-28th Feb – mobile world congress](http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/) 
* [24th February — game on competigion](https://gameon.mozilla.org/en-US/)

## Topics 

* [Firefox OS Simulator Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-os-simulator/) is a separated process and you can get the actual B2G in your desktop — this is probably an approach to take and change Gecko chrome for the braves in the web app that want to be closer to the 'chrome'.
