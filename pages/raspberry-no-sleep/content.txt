This article explains how to get a Raspberry PI, in Raspbian and one that uses X, to not sleep. 

## Requirements

    Raspberry Rev A or B 
    Raspbian OS 

## Edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf


    Section "ServerFlags"
       Option "BlankTime" "0"
       Option "StandbyTime" "0"
       Option "SuspendTime" "0"
       Option "OffTime" "0"
    EndSection

    Section "Monitor"
       Identifier  "Monitor"
       Option "DPMS" "false"
    EndSection

## Other approach (never really worked for me)

The following never worked for my X app but I found in many articles - please help this article if you have a doubt - mgalli at telasocial dot com. 

   vi /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc 

And add the lines: 

   xset s off         # don't activate screensaver
   xset -dpms         # disable DPMS (Energy Star) features.
   xset s noblank     # don't blank the video device
