## Requirements

    Raspberry Rev A or B 
    Raspbian OS

For rotate in vertical you can try: 

    display_rotate=1        90 degrees

## Reboot 

    reboot

## Test

If does not work, specifically you may find this with Rev B and a lot of threads, including threads talking about Safe Mode. But simply try: 

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade

If does not work try: 

    apt-get install rpi-update
    rpi-update
